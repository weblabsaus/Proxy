## Bypass low-level censorship and conserve your privacy and rights!.

### Introduction & Use-Cases

The main use-case scenario is if you're a privacy-conscious individual who wish for their privacy to be respected by others as much as they can. Using this service can ease in the use of accessing other services through privacy-respecting WWW Proxies by 'ethically and legally exploiting' their APIs.

This project aims to end Local Network internet censorship at a high level. This repository is designed to be easily reproducable and at a low or non-existent price as it is a 'static website' but also uses no javascript.

I DO NOT CONDONE THIS but another example of where this program is applicable is in a school, workplace or hotel where local network blocking is used either by using 'Trick Domain Name Server(s) or TDNS for short' or any other means. Again, I RECOMMEND AGAINST USING MY PROJECT FOR THIS, YOUR FAULT IF YOU GET FIRED.

Also... No Javascript! https://www.infoworld.com/article/2641586/javascript-considered-harmful-.html

### Submitting issues

Please submit issues in the issues tab such as:
- The website not working as intended
- Consistency errors on the website
- A single service not being accessible at all for you from any of the links on the network you're using.
- If you have suggestions on how to make this project better.

Sorry for messy folders!

### Legal & Licensing

If anyone has licensing issues please contact me by placing an issue on this GitHub repository. If you forking or just using my project for commerical use, feel free as long as it follows my license this project is under, (the GPL v2.0 and **not** the GPL v3.0).\

There are some potential licensing issues with this project although they are a stretch and may or may not be covered by fair use. One of these such issues is that this repo uses the SCE-PS3 Rodin LATIN font (provided as courtesy of onlinewebfonts). This is the font used by Sony Computer Entertainment for the FreeBSD XMB interface of the PS3, PSP, PSX and PSVita. This font is thought to be under copyright of Fontworks Japan although this is not a 100% solid fact.\

Unlike my *previous* projects *cough cough* yuck.ga *cough cough* that had licensing issues due to using conflicting open-source licenses by borrowing code from other repositories (which is partly why yuck.ga is now **deprecated**) this repository doesn't use much if any lines of code from other projects.

There is also some CC-BY 4.0 code in here, written by [Garret Howard](https://github.com/garrhow). This is his GitHub: https://github.com/garrhow, and this is his website: https://mersh.com but I made a mirror of it since it is not working at the moment: https://mersh-mirror.netlify.app.

### Privacy

The privacy policy for the default instance of unblockit (tiber.ml, invl.netlify.app and yuck.tk) can be found /privacy.html. Ads can be easily removed in your fork or rehost and probably won't even work out of the box. You can also remove ads by signing up for tibernet premium for Â£0.10 a month (coming soon).
